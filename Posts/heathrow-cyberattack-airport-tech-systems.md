**Heathrow Airport** and several major European airports were thrown into chaos this past weekend after a **supply-chain cyberattack** targeted the check-in and boarding software provided by U.S.-based Collins Aerospace. The attack forced airlines to revert to manual check-ins, causing hours of delays and cancellations across thousands of flights.

This disruption affected millions of passengers, as airlines scrambled to maintain operations without automated systems. British Airways, one of the hardest hit, managed to operate about 90% of its flights on Saturday but warned of ongoing limited impacts. The National Cyber Security Center in the UK is actively investigating alongside Collins Aerospace, law enforcement, and government agencies to assess the scope and response.

## Why This Cyberattack Shook Europe’s Airports

Here's why this matters:

- **Massive passenger impact:** Automated check-in and boarding systems went offline, causing long queues and flight delays.
- **Supply-chain attack complexity:** Hackers exploited vulnerabilities in a third-party vendor, bypassing direct airline defenses.
- **Critical infrastructure risk:** Airports depend heavily on connected tech, making them vulnerable to cascading failures.
- **Regulatory scrutiny:** The UK's NIS Regulations will likely force full disclosure and future tighter controls on such supply-chain risks.

| Impact Area         | Details                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Passenger Experience| Long lines, cancellations, travel disruptions |
| Industry Response   | Manual overrides, contingency planning       |
| Security Outlook    | Increased focus on third-party software risks|
| Regulation          | Calls for stricter reporting and controls    |

## Under the Hood of the Attack

The attack targeted the **MUSE check-in and boarding software** supplied by Collins Aerospace, a critical third-party system used by airlines globally. This is a textbook **supply-chain attack**, where hackers compromise software vendors to indirectly breach large infrastructure.

Think of it like poisoning the water supply instead of attacking individual houses. By infiltrating Collins Aerospace’s systems or software updates, attackers caused airline systems reliant on MUSE to malfunction simultaneously.

Technical specifics remain undisclosed, but experts suspect either a ransomware variant or a **denial-of-service (DoS)** attack that overwhelmed or encrypted files on the systems. The exact entry vector—whether through unpatched vulnerabilities, phishing, or compromised credentials—is still under investigation.

The asymmetric nature of such attacks makes defense extremely difficult: securing every software vendor and third-party is a monumental challenge, while attackers only need one weak link to disrupt entire industries.

## What’s Next for Airports and Cybersecurity?

So where does this go from here?

- **Regulatory pressure** will mount on airports and vendors to demonstrate improved security and incident transparency.
- Airlines and airports will accelerate **contingency plans** for manual operations and system redundancies.
- Collins Aerospace faces intense scrutiny to patch vulnerabilities and reassure customers.
- The incident serves as a warning that **supply-chain cybersecurity** must become a top priority across critical infrastructure sectors.

Watch for announcements from UK regulators and Collins Aerospace in the coming weeks detailing the attack vector and mitigation steps. Airlines may also revise their contracts and security requirements for third-party providers.

## Bottom line:

*This attack highlights how deeply intertwined and vulnerable modern airport systems are to cyber threats from third-party software, underscoring urgent need for stronger supply-chain defenses and operational resilience.*
