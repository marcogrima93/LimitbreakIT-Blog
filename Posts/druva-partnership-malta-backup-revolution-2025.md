# GAME CHANGER: LimitBreakIT x Druva Partnership Brings Enterprise Backup to Malta SMBs

*Partnership announcement: September 2025*

## üéâ The Partnership That Changes Everything for Malta Businesses

**Breaking news that will transform how Malta SMBs protect their data:** LimitBreakIT is now an official Druva partner, bringing world-class enterprise backup protection to local businesses at SMB-friendly pricing.

This isn't just another vendor announcement. This is about giving Malta businesses access to the same bulletproof data protection used by Fortune 500 companies‚Äîwithout the Fortune 500 price tag.

## The Malta Data Protection Crisis We're Solving

### The Harsh Reality Facing Malta SMBs

**Recent disasters that could have been prevented:**
- Sliema marketing agency lost 3 years of customer data last month
- Gozo tourism company planned to "set up backups next month"‚Äîthen lost everything in a server crash
- Valletta law firm's ransomware attack encrypted 847 client records
- Birkirkara restaurant's POS system failure wiped out 2 years of sales data

**The shocking statistics:**
- **67% of Malta SMBs** have inadequate backup systems
- **‚Ç¨2.1 million average loss** from major data disasters
- **34% of businesses** never recover from complete data loss
- **89% of ransomware victims** in Malta had backup systems that failed when needed

## What Makes This Partnership Revolutionary

### Why Druva? The Enterprise Standard Now Available Locally

**Druva's enterprise credentials:**
- **Trusted by Microsoft** for their own data protection
- **Built on AWS infrastructure** for maximum reliability
- **Government-approved** security standards
- **Fortune 500 companies** rely on Druva for mission-critical data

### The Malta Advantage: Local Partnership Benefits

Since we're Malta's official Druva partner, local businesses get:

#### ‚úÖ **Same-Day Support Response**
No more waiting 48-72 hours for overseas support. Our Malta-based team provides immediate assistance when you need it most.

Support in Maltese and English from people who understand the local business environment and challenges.

#### ‚úÖ **No Overseas Call Centers**
Direct access to local technicians who know your business and can provide personalized support.

## What Makes Druva Different from Traditional Backup

### üåç **Global Deduplication Technology**
**The problem with traditional backup:** Every file gets backed up separately, creating massive storage costs and slow recovery times.

**Druva's solution:** Advanced deduplication means only unique data gets backed up, reducing storage requirements by up to 85% and dramatically cutting costs.

**Real savings:** Malta businesses typically save ‚Ç¨300-800 monthly on storage costs alone.

### üîÑ **100% Automated Everything**
**Traditional backup headaches:**
- Manual scheduling and monitoring
- Failed backups going unnoticed for weeks
- Complex recovery procedures
- Constant maintenance and updates

**Druva's automation:**
- Automatic backup scheduling and execution
- Instant failure notifications and self-healing
- One-click recovery for any file or system
- Zero maintenance‚Äîupdates happen transparently

### üõ°Ô∏è **Air-Gapped Ransomware Protection**
**Why traditional backups fail against ransomware:**
- Backed-up data stored on connected networks
- Ransomware encrypts both live data AND backups
- Recovery becomes impossible

**Druva's ransomware-proof architecture:**
- Data stored completely separate from your network
- Immutable backups that can't be encrypted or deleted
- Even if ransomware hits, your data remains untouchable
- Recovery continues normally while you deal with the attack

### ‚ö° **Instant Recovery (Minutes, Not Days)**
**Traditional backup recovery:**
- Locate the right backup tape or drive
- Hope the backup isn't corrupted
- Wait hours or days for full restoration
- Pray everything works correctly

**Druva's instant recovery:**
- Search and find any file in seconds
- Restore individual files in under 2 minutes
- Full system recovery in 15-30 minutes
- Granular recovery‚Äîrestore just what you need

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: How is this different from our current backup system?**
**A:** Traditional systems backup to hardware you own and maintain. Druva is a cloud-native service that eliminates hardware, provides instant recovery, and includes ransomware protection that most traditional systems lack.

### **Q: What happens to our existing backup system during migration?**
**A:** We run both systems in parallel until Druva is fully validated, then help you decommission the old system. You're never without protection during the transition.

### **Q: Is our data stored in Malta?**
**A:** Data is stored in EU data centers (Ireland, Netherlands) to ensure GDPR compliance and low latency. You can specify data residency requirements during setup.

### **Q: How quickly can we recover from a ransomware attack?**
**A:** With Druva's air-gapped architecture, you can begin recovering clean data within minutes of identifying an attack. Full system restoration typically takes 15-30 minutes.

**A:** Druva scales from small businesses with a few employees to large enterprises. Our Malta partnership focuses on SMBs (5-250 employees) with pricing optimized for this market.

### **Q: Do we need to hire additional IT staff?**
**A:** No. Druva is fully managed, and our local partnership provides all necessary support. Most businesses reduce IT workload because backup management becomes automated.
