**Emirates Airlines** is making a bold safety move that will stop travelers in their tracks: starting October 1, 2025, the use of power banks onboard flights is completely banned. Passengers can still carry a single power bank under 100 watt-hours, but it must remain unused for the entire flight. No charging devices, no recharging the power bank itself via in-seat power — nothing. This is not a minor tweak; it’s a response to a surge in lithium battery incidents threatening flight safety.

## The Safety Crisis Behind the Ban

In recent years, the number of lithium battery-related incidents on aircraft has spiked, raising serious fire hazard concerns. Power banks, which are essentially portable lithium-ion or lithium-polymer battery packs for charging phones, tablets, and even laptops, have become a common cause. Emirates conducted a comprehensive safety review that revealed the growing risks these devices pose during flights. To combat this, Emirates now requires power banks to be clearly labeled with their capacity and mandates that they be stored only in the seat pocket or under the seat in front—not in overhead compartments.

## What Exactly Is Changing for Passengers?

Passengers can still bring one power bank under 100Wh in their carry-on baggage, but:

- The power bank **cannot be used at all during the flight**.
- It must remain unused and cannot be plugged into the aircraft’s in-seat power supply.
- Devices should be fully charged before boarding, as charging inflight with power banks is no longer allowed.

Emirates’ aircraft still offer in-seat charging ports, but relying on those means travelers must plan ahead and make sure their devices are charged before takeoff.

## Why Lithium Batteries Are Such a Big Deal

Lithium-ion batteries pack a lot of energy in a small space, but they can be volatile. Physical damage, manufacturing defects, or overcharging can trigger thermal runaway — a chain reaction that results in fires or explosions. Fires caused by lithium batteries are notoriously hard to extinguish and pose an extreme hazard onboard a plane where evacuation options are limited.

Power banks vary widely in quality and safety features, and their increasing use has correlated with a rise in inflight battery incidents globally. Regulators and airlines worldwide are grappling with how to balance convenience with safety. Emirates’ ban is a strict but decisive step acknowledging these evolving risks.

## Industry-Wide Implications and What Comes Next

Emirates’ new rule could set a precedent for other airlines, especially as authorities tighten regulations around lithium battery carriage and use on planes. Travelers will need to adjust habits, especially frequent flyers and tech-heavy travelers who rely on power banks for long-haul flights.

This ban also raises awareness about the importance of understanding battery ratings and the potential risks of portable chargers. While the ban currently applies only to power bank use, future regulations could tighten further depending on incident trends.

## Bottom line:

*Emirates’ ban on power bank use onboard flights starting October 2025 is a sharp response to growing lithium battery fire hazards. Passengers must now plan device charging carefully and respect new safety rules to keep flights secure.*
