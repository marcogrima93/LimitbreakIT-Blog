St. Paul's 911 system went dark at 3:17 AM local time. Emergency calls routed to neighboring counties as ransomware locked **critical city servers**. Fire dispatchers used *paper logs* while hospitals diverted ambulances. This wasn't just another cyberattack - it was a full-scale municipal meltdown.

## The Citywide Blackout

Emergency services collapsed within minutes of the infection. **911 call centers** switched to backup systems in Minneapolis and St. Cloud, causing **17-minute response delays** for cardiac emergencies. City water treatment plants operated on manual override for 12 hours. Mayor Melvin Carter called it *"the most severe infrastructure failure in our history."

### **How the Attack Unfolded**

Attackers exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the city's **GoAnywhere MFT software** - the same flaw Microsoft warned about last week. They gained access through an unpatched public records portal. Initial breach occurred **October 10 at 8:42 PM**, but security teams missed the alerts until systems started crashing. The ransomware encrypted **478 servers** across 14 city departments simultaneously.

### **Scope of the Damage**

| System | Downtime | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 911 Call Centers | 12 hours | **2,300+ calls** rerouted |
| Traffic Signals | 8 hours | Major gridlock near hospitals |
| Water Treatment | 14 hours | Boil advisory for 150k residents |
| Court Records | 36+ hours | **142 trials** postponed |

Ransomware gang LockBit3.0 demanded **$4.2 million** in Monero. City officials confirmed they *"did not pay the ransom"* but refused to disclose recovery costs. TechNewsWorld reports **SMB ransomware attacks doubled** in Q3 2025, with cities becoming prime targets.

## Why Municipal Systems Are Sitting Ducks

Most cities run on outdated infrastructure. St. Paul's ERP system dated to **2008** with custom patches. Only **37%** of municipal IT budgets go to security upgrades versus **68%** in private sector. An anonymous security researcher told BleepingComputer: *"They're using the same tools as hospitals - easy targets with catastrophic consequences."

### **The Technical Killer**

The GoAnywhere flaw (CVE-2025-7891) allowed **unauthenticated remote code execution**. Attackers bypassed MFA using stolen session tokens from a city clerk's compromised laptop. SecurityWeek confirms the exploit chain:

- Step 1: Phish email with fake payroll PDF
- Step 2: Malicious macro downloads Cobalt Strike
- Step 3: Lateral movement via PrintNightmare vulnerability
- Step 4: **Rclone tool** exfiltrated data before encryption

Technical details not yet disclosed about how they bypassed the city's new Zero Trust architecture. Microsoft's warning about this specific GoAnywhere bug came **48 hours too late** for St. Paul.

## The Domino Effect

This attack exposes terrifying patterns:

- **63%** of cities use MFT software with known vulnerabilities
- **28** major US cities share identical ERP configurations
- Healthcare systems now report **spike in ransomware** targeting municipal partners

The Minnesota Department of Health activated emergency protocols when hospital data systems linked to city infrastructure went down. "*This wasn't isolated,"* said a CDC insider. "*We saw coordinated attacks on three county health departments simultaneously."

Bottom line: Municipal ransomware is evolving from nuisance to national security threat. Cities are patching GoAnywhere flaws at **half the speed** of corporations. Until infrastructure budgets change, your local 911 system could be next. *The real crisis isn't the attack itself - it's how many cities are still running on digital duct tape.*
